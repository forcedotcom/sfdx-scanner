# Salesforce Code Analyzer
Salesforce Code Analyzer is a unified tool for static analysis of source code.
Code Analyzer analyzes multiple languages.
It relies on a consistent command-line interface and produces a results file of rule violations.
Use the results to review and improve your code.

If you're listing a managed package on AppExchange, it must pass security review.
You're also required to upload your Salesforce Code Analyzer scan reports.
Attach your Code Analyzer reports to your submission in the AppExchange Security Review Wizard.
For more info, read [Scan Your Code with Salesforce Code Analyzer](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/security_review_code_analyzer_scan.htm) and [AppExchange Security Review](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/security_review_overview.htm).

Code Analyzer current supports the PMD rule engine, PMD Copy Paste Detector, ESLint, RetireJS, and Salesforce Graph Engine.

Integrate Code Analyzer into your Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD) process to enforce rules that you define and to produce high-quality code.
