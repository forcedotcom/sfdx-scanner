      Oftentimes, you can resolve `scanner run dfa` issues on your own. Follow these steps:
      1. Read the error message.
      2. Read [Salesforce Graph Engine](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/guide/salesforce-graph-engine.html) documentation.
      3. Read our guide for [troubleshooting Graph Engine errors](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/guide/troubleshooting.html).
      4. Read our guidelines to resolve [LimitReached errors](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/guide/working-with-graph-engine.html#limitreached-errors) and [path evaluation timeouts](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/guide/troubleshooting.html#issues-using-salesforce-graph-engine).
      5. Read our [Guide to Writing Graph Engine-Friendly Code](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/salesforce-code-analyzer/guide/graph-engine-friendly-code.html).
      6. Double-check the command that you entered. Ensure that items like file names, method names, and category names are correctly spelled and cased.
      7. Verify that your code is syntactically valid.
      8. Verify that the error is reproducible on another machine.
      9. Check open and closed [issues](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdx-scanner/issues) to see if your issue is already logged.
      10. If there's no existing issue that covers your situation, log a new issue.

      If you're listing a managed package on AppExchange, prepare for the security review by following the instructions in the [Scan Your Solution with Salesforce Code Analyzer](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/security_review_code_analyzer_scan.htm) section of the ISVforce Guide.
      *Note: In your scan report, if you see an InternalExecutionError or a LimitReached error, you can still submit for AppExchange security review. These errors aren't blockers.*

      **I confirm that I have gone through these steps and still have an issue to report.**
