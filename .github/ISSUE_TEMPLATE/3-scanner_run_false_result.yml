      Oftentimes, a rule is not directly owned by Salesforce Code Analyzer but instead owned by the underlying tool associated with the rule (like PMD or eslint for example). Before reporting this issue, please check to see if running the corresponding tool separate from Salesforce Code Analyzer also gives you a false positive. If so, then please create an issue with that corresponding tool instead of here. Otherwise, create your issue here.

      **I have verified that the issue is only reproducible when running through Salesforce Code Analyzer.**
